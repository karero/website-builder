# A linked worktree has no copy of the gitignored list; use the main checkout's, as check_clean.sh does.
# It runs in the C locale, as check_clean.sh does, so both read "the names" byte for byte alike
# (an em space is no space to either). It refuses a list with no names, or with an entry
# holding ^ other than right after [ (the check refuses those, a literal \^ included). It reads
# the names once, so what it sends and what it records are the same: the names base64-encoded
# on one line, after a marker line the CI step requires (.github/workflows/clean.yml says why),
# and their checksum in <list>.pushed, so `make check` fails once the names change after that.
