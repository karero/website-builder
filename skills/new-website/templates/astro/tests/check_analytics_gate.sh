# Regression guard for the analytics switch in src/config.ts:
#   ANALYTICS.enabled = process.env.CF_PAGES_BRANCH === PROD_BRANCH
#
# Base.astro emits the Plausible <script> only when that is true, and the build decides it:
# Cloudflare sets CF_PAGES_BRANCH when it builds, and a deploy-by-command owner sets it by
# hand (`CF_PAGES_BRANCH=<production-branch> npm run build` for the live site, PUBLISHING.md;
# `CF_PAGES_BRANCH= npm run build` for a preview, new-website's CLOUDFLARE_FIRST_DEPLOY.md).
# Both ways it fails silently: off on the live site, it counts no visitors and nothing says
# so; on for a preview, every look at the preview is counted as a real visitor. The
# Playwright suite cannot see either, since it builds once with whatever the shell had. So
# this builds the site four ways, the way the docs tell the owner to, and reads the built
# HTML. The toolkit's own CI runs it (template-tests.yml); a site's CI does not.
#
# It runs `astro build`, the step of `npm run build` that renders the pages and so decides
# the tag, into a temporary folder: the site's own dist/ is left alone. The two post-build
# steps after it touch heading ids and dist/build.txt only.
#
# Needs `npm ci` first. Each build takes a few seconds.
