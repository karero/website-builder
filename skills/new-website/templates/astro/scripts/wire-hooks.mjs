// Run by the "prepare" script in package.json, so on every `npm install`: points git's
// core.hooksPath at scripts/hooks, which turns on the pre-push gate in scripts/hooks/pre-push.
//
// Why a Node script instead of a line of shell in package.json: npm hands a script line to
// a shell, by default sh on macOS and Linux and cmd.exe on Windows. The line this replaces
// (`unset …; git rev-parse … 2>/dev/null | grep -q . || git config … || true`) is sh
// syntax; `node scripts/wire-hooks.mjs` holds no shell syntax at all.
//
// What it does, and must keep doing:
//  - site at the root of its git repo: set core.hooksPath to scripts/hooks;
//  - site in a subfolder of a bigger repo: change nothing. Pointed at a scripts/hooks the
//    bigger repo does not have, git runs none of that repo's hooks, and says nothing;
//  - no git repo around the site, or no git on this machine: nothing to do;
//  - never fail the install: every case above exits 0, without a word. If git refuses the
//    write at a repo's root, that is one line on stderr and still exit 0.

// of the working tree, so a site in a subfolder would pass for the root. Without the two, git
// finds the repo from the site's folder.
