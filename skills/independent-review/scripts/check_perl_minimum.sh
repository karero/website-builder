#!/usr/bin/env bash
# independent_review.sh runs its Perl programs from perl/*.pl. Each file declares the Perl it needs
# (`use 5.0xx;`), and this check holds it to that with Perl::MinimumVersion (the library behind
# `perlver`): a file whose syntax needs a newer Perl than it declares fails, and so does a file
# declaring more than its path allows. The programs the HTTP API transports run (GATED) may need up
# to the version api_tools_ok probes for; the ones that run with no version check (UNGATED: the
# ollama CLI filter, and readable_tail for any tier's FAILED section) may need no more than 5.8.
# Every file must be in exactly one list, so a new program has to be placed. Before 2026-10-06 the
# programs were inline and guarded one construct at a time (no r-flag substitution, no `//` in the
# CLI filter); the tool checks every construct it knows.
#
# Perl::MinimumVersion knows constructs, not everything: it reads syntax, so a core module or a
# built-in's newer behaviour can slip past (it is the tool's limit, not a promise of 5.8 safety). The
# runtime tests (test_failed_tier_report.sh, sections 35 and 36) run the transports under a Perl
# that refuses the version probe; that proves the skip, not that the ungated files compile on 5.8.
#
# Always checked, with or without the module: every perl/*.pl is run by independent_review.sh, is
# listed here, and declares a version; every file the script runs or this check lists exists; and
# the script mentions perl only in the forms it is allowed (perl_lines below), so no inline program
# can come back. Without the module the version check is skipped and the run ends on a SKIP line;
# REQUIRE_PERL_MINIMUM=1 (CI) makes that a failure. Install: apt libperl-minimumversion-perl, or
# CPAN Perl::MinimumVersion.
# Scope: independent_review.sh and perl/. The repo's own checks and merge_link.sh keep their few
# lines of Perl inline, outside this check.
# It tests itself first on fixtures, each for the reason it must fail, because a guard that cannot
# fire is worse than none.
