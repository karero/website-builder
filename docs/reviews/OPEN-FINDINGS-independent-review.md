# Open findings — `skills/independent-review/SKILL.md`

Living tracker. Every row is a review finding that is **not** closed. Close a row by fixing or
refuting it (BUG), or by fixing, refuting, or recording an owner waiver (RISK/NIT) — then delete
the row, with the disposition recorded in that round's trail.

Last updated 2026-09-26, three times: SKILL.md point 5 now allows a signed-off deferral, so
R-VERDICT-TEXT's BUG half moved to the BUG table as B-VERDICT-TEXT and B-TAGCLASS is marked
non-compliant; R-PROJCTX was added, from the codex non-git-dir fix; and the owner's 2026-09-22
decision on the clean-verdict qualifier fix was recorded in B-REFUSAL-TEXT and R-VERDICT-TEXT, and
R-VERDICT-TEXT widened to the passive voice. On
2026-09-20 that fix added R-VERDICT-TEXT and widened B-REFUSAL-TEXT. Before that 2026-09-12, after
the mechanism-claim prompt change was reconciled with the tool-less tier and the remaining sandbox
assurances were hedged. Added 2026-09-11: B-REFUSAL-TEXT and R-SANDBOX. Before that, 2026-08-29,
after the model-agnosticism round added B-TAGCLASS below. Previous update 2026-08-04, after the
permission-table collapse. Reviewers to date: Codex `gpt-5.6-sol` and `gpt-6-astra` (read-only),
ollama-cloud `glm-5.2` and `kimi-k2.7-code:cloud`, Kimi `kimi-k3:cloud`, host fresh-eyes passes
(Claude Opus 5 and later), and a host-family Double-Knuth pass on the qualifier fix's PR.

## Gate status: three open BUGs — B-REFUSAL-TEXT and B-VERDICT-TEXT deferred under SKILL.md point 5; B-TAGCLASS not deferrable yet, so it blocks any gate that raises it

Every BUG raised up to the Kimi round was closed; the three above came later. **For those Kimi-round
fixes, no reviewer has seen the applied result.**
Kimi reviewed the *draft* and returned "ship with the listed fixes"; those fixes were then applied,
so the committed text is one edit-generation ahead of anything any reviewer has read. Per the
skill's own vocabulary: `locally_verified`, not `externally_reverified`. One more round would
close that, and is the single highest-value thing left here.

**Deferred BUGs and the rule.** Since 2026-09-26, SKILL.md point 5 lets the owner defer a BUG
the change did not introduce: every wrong input its row quotes goes wrong at the merge-base, the row
here carries a dated sign-off, and KNOWN WRONG tests in CI pin those inputs. A widening does not
qualify. B-REFUSAL-TEXT and B-VERDICT-TEXT meet all three. Their 2026-09-20 widening was accepted
before this rule existed; since that change merged, its inputs go wrong on `main` too, so for any
later change they are pre-existing. B-TAGCLASS does not qualify yet: it has neither the sign-off
nor the test.

## BUG — open (pre-existing, each left out of the PR that found it; whether each is DEFERRED under SKILL.md point 5 is in its row)

| id | Location | Finding | Found |
|---|---|---|---|
| B-TAGCLASS | `independent_review.sh` `is_cloud_ollama_tag()` + setup-guide RAM table | The `*:120b`/`*:405b`/`*:480b` arms classify locality by size suffix, but the tag alone underdetermines it: a locally-pulled `gpt-oss:120b` (the RAM table's own 96 GB+ recommendation) is refused under `--local-only`, and set explicitly outside it would count as gate-eligible cloud. Needs locality derived from ollama metadata (which store the tag actually resolves in), with ONE classifier shared by auto-detect, local-only enforcement, and gate eligibility. Pre-existing (suffix arms predate the agnosticism change); left open because the fix is a design change, not a scrub. **Does not meet SKILL.md point 5's exception yet:** no dated owner sign-off is recorded (the 2026-08-29 trails say only "deferred, open") and no test pins the wrong classification as KNOWN WRONG. Until both exist it blocks any gate that raises it. | Codex 2026-08-29 |
| B-REFUSAL-TEXT | `independent_review.sh` `looks_like_review()` | Refusal detection is a text test on responses with at most one finding, and text cannot separate a refusal from a finding. Two refusal-shaped findings ("1. BUG — I cannot review the file." / "2. RISK — I cannot access the repository.") are accepted as a review; a lone real finding saying "the handler cannot return JSON" is rejected; and a lone honest finding that cannot read its evidence is rejected even when marked UNVERIFIABLE. Round 13 changed the prompt and did **not** narrow this as much as it first appeared. `PROMPT_CORE` now files an evidence gap as an UNVERIFIABLE entry rather than a finding, phrased about the claim rather than the reviewer's own access, and dictates the clean verdict word for word. Codex then showed that **the shape the prompt now prescribes is itself discarded**: `No BUG/RISK/NIT findings.` followed by `UNVERIFIABLE: library X cannot provide the stated durability` is rejected, because the refusal regex matches "cannot provide" anywhere and the reply carries no finding lines. An UNVERIFIABLE entry is *about* what a component cannot do, so this collides head-on with the rule the same round added. Pinned as a KNOWN WRONG case. **Changing the prompt cannot fix this** — it needs the status contract described below. The pilot did not hit it: every seat there carried many findings, which disables the refusal check. Two exemptions for the last case (the marker; the marker plus a file:line anchor) were tried and withdrawn on 2026-09-11, because each let a refusal through. Four more false accepts were found in round 10: a lone finding saying "I couldn't access", "I don't have access to", "I can not review" or "I was unable to view" passes as a review. Needs a design change, such as a status the reviewer states apart from its findings, not a further regex. Pre-existing: all three reproduce on the origin/main function. `test_looks_like_review.sh` pins all of these as KNOWN WRONG cases, so a fix has to change them on purpose. **Widened 2026-09-20, knowingly:** the clean-verdict check now also accepts a qualified verdict ("No confirmed BUG or RISK"), so the four phrases the refusal check misses pass after that wording too — in prose, with no finding line: "No confirmed BUG or RISK, because I couldn't access the diff you supplied." After a plain "No BUG or RISK" each already passed. Pinned KNOWN WRONG beside the others. | Codex 2026-09-11 (rounds 4-6), ollama-cloud (round 10); deferral signed off by the owner 2026-09-11. Widening: Codex, ollama-cloud and the fresh-eyes seat, 2026-09-20; Codex rated it BUG (G2); accepted by the owner 2026-09-22 |
| B-VERDICT-TEXT | `independent_review.sh` `looks_like_review()`, check 3 | Split from R-VERDICT-TEXT on 2026-09-26: its false-accept half, which Codex rated BUG (G3). The clean-verdict check is a text test, and nothing constrains what follows the severity word, so a non-answer that uses it as a noun modifier counts as a review — "No further bug reports can be generated: usage limit reached." The same goes for the passive voice, which needs no refusal phrase at all: "No significant risk can be assessed without the file contents.", "The diff was empty, so no confirmed bugs could be evaluated.", "no further risk analysis possible". A genuine verdict takes that shape too ("No confirmed bugs could be found in this diff."), so only a list of verbs meaning "not done" could tell them apart, and that is a refusal list. Pre-existing: the unqualified forms ("No bug reports can be generated", "No risk can be assessed without the file contents.") already passed before 2026-09-20. The qualifier list added that day widened it. A tail constraint (punctuation, or a short list of following words) was considered and declined: it rejects ordinary verdicts such as "No confirmed bugs here" and "No confirmed BUG — the change is sound". Same remedy as B-REFUSAL-TEXT — a status the reviewer states apart from its prose. `test_looks_like_review.sh` pins the pre-existing forms and every widened one as KNOWN WRONG. | Fresh-eyes seat and ollama-cloud, 2026-09-20; passive voice: a host-family Double-Knuth pass, 2026-09-26. Deferral and widening signed off by the owner 2026-09-22; the owner confirmed 2026-09-26 that it covers the passive voice |

## RISK — open

| id | Location | Finding | Found |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-SANDBOX | `independent_review.sh`, the comments above `PROMPT_CORE`, the header, `run_codex` and `run_agy`; `SKILL.md`'s reviewer list | The comments above `PROMPT_CORE` said `-s read-only` "already blocks writes" and that "the real boundary is the sandbox"; since round 10 those two comments say enforcement is untested, and since round 13 so do the other three sites that carried the same assurance unhedged — the script's header SECURITY block, the comment above the Codex invocation, and SKILL.md's reviewer list. Round 4 extended it to the **Antigravity** tier, whose comment made the same two unbacked claims (`--sandbox` restricts commands; `-p` never auto-approves tool calls); both are now written as requested, not enforced. **The finding itself is still open:** every site now describes what the flag REQUESTS, which is all that was ever checked; nothing tests what either CLI enforces. Pre-existing; raised by the new mechanism-claim sentence on its first run over this file. | Codex 2026-09-11 (round 5); waived by the owner for the 2026-09-11 PR, and still open here |
| R-PROJCTX | `independent_review.sh` `run_codex` (the notes above `codex_bin`) | A reviewed project can still put its own text into the codex reviewer's instructions. `-c project_doc_max_bytes=0` keeps a project AGENTS.md out (seen live on codex 0.157.0: a planted AGENTS.md was obeyed without it and ignored with it), but codex also loads repo-scoped skills into a `## Skills` developer section (seen in the 0.157.0 binary's strings, not run), and other codex features that read project content may do the same — 0.157.0 also carries project hooks (`hooks.json`, gated by hook trust) and project execpolicy `.rules` files (`codex exec --ignore-rules` skips them); neither was tested in an untrusted dir. A PR that adds such a file could steer its own review. Pre-existing inside a git repo; `--skip-git-repo-check` extends it to non-git dirs, where codex used to refuse to start. The AGENTS.md setting itself is seen working in one live probe, not tested. Candidates: `-c skills.include_instructions=false`, `--ignore-rules`; both untested. | Fresh-eyes 2026-09-26 (round 3 of the fix/codex-untrusted-dir DIFF gate); tracked rather than chased, owner decision 2026-09-26 |
| R-VERDICT-TEXT | `independent_review.sh` `looks_like_review()`, check 3 | The clean-verdict check is a text test, and rejects some real verdicts (its false accepts are B-VERDICT-TEXT). **False rejects, all older than the 2026-09-20 qualifier fix:** a severity word in bold or backticks ("No confirmed **BUG**"), a verdict wrapped across two lines, a double space, and any qualifier outside the literal list ("No critical bugs", "No potential RISK"). Each costs one seat, loudly: the tier is reported `FAILED (output is not a review)` with the reply quoted. Same remedy as B-REFUSAL-TEXT, not a longer regex. | Fresh-eyes seat and ollama-cloud, 2026-09-20 |
| R-CI | clerk item 2 | The local `(base, head)` capture is fixed, but the marker still stamps a single SHA and nothing names **which platform field a CI gate should compare** — GitLab and GitHub differ, and "the commit actually being merged" ≠ source head under squash or merge-commit flows. **Blocked on a cross-repo decision**: a downstream repo's `review-trail-posted-gate` job depends on the current single-SHA form, so changing it is a two-repo change. | Codex r4, Kimi |
| R-SEATS | clerk item 2 | "Every seat that participated in the verdict" is still undefined for attempted-but-failed, degraded, or manually excluded seats — an implementation can omit a required seat by declaring non-participation. Wants a required-seat roster persisted before execution. | Codex r4 |
| R1-8 | onboarding step 2 | "Installed and authenticated" can route local-only ollama into the skip branch; `ollama list` doesn't prove a `:cloud` tag is signed in. Needs a concrete cloud-readiness probe. | Codex r1 |
| R1-9 | Procedure step 1 | `grep` for secrets is too weak for customer data, encoded credentials, or creds in URLs; first-time owner approval goes stale as repo sensitivity changes. Needs real preflight tooling. | Codex r1 |
| R1-10 | reviewer stack §3 / step 3 | The "fresh session" fallback has no enforceable way to create or verify isolation; on hosts without sub-agents it can silently degrade into the authoring context while still counting as fresh-eyes. | Codex r1 |
| R1-11 | onboarding step 5 | Model-family confirmation depends on parsing human-oriented CLI output, with `agy`'s format admitted unconfirmed. Needs a maintained per-CLI compatibility table or a machine-readable probe. | Codex r1 |

## NIT — open

| id | Location | Finding | Found |
|---|---|---|---|
| N1-14 | clerk §1 vs §3 | Raw notes are posted verbatim to the PR, but the permanent trail keeps only dispositions — later audit depends on PR-comment survival. Decide: embed raw notes, link immutable comment ids, or store hashes plus a durable archive. | Codex r1 |

## Not a finding — deliberate follow-on work

- **A lint.** The permission table is now the single place that grants or denies, which is the
  precondition for mechanically checking it. Candidate checks: no section other than the table
  states a grant or a fallback; every `see X` cross-reference resolves; the marker token appears
  exactly once. A lint catches *regression* of what is now correct — it would have found none of
  the BUGs in this history, all of which were reasoning errors.
- **Policy: changes to this file go through the gate.** Across five rounds every single one found
  something real, including three that found defects in the immediately preceding round's fixes.
  Nothing else here has that hit rate.

## Closed — history, do not re-litigate

**Round 1 (Codex)** — 4 BUGs: the marker's stamp-current-HEAD inversion, "every configured
reviewer runs together" contradicting Antigravity opt-in, "run every tier", and the unconditional
trail write. All fixed in `99c89e3`.

**Round 2 (Codex + ollama)** — 3 BUGs in the *proposed* fixes: B4 closed only locally, a factually
wrong `git commit -a` claim (it does not stage untracked files), and a false "local ollama never
runs automatically" claim refuted against `independent_review.sh:112`. All fixed in `99c89e3`.

**Round 3 (Codex + ollama)** — gate FAILED; step 7(c) oscillation fired. The fix for one finding
had re-opened the hole another fix had just closed. Diagnosis: "ownership" was doing three jobs.
Redesign in `e45e5b9`.

**Round 4 (Codex + ollama)** — 5 BUGs, 2 of them introduced by the redesign itself. Codex
prescribed splitting three properties into five.

**Round 5 (Kimi)** — rejected that prescription and returned verdict (c): the taxonomy was stated
normatively in five places and the defects had become *pairwise non-entailment among redundant
statements*, so the cure was fewer normative statements, not more properties. Its prediction that
patching would keep leaking was confirmed within the hour, in a fix that added a third statement
about budget rather than reconciling the two that already conflicted.

**Round 6 (Kimi, on the draft)** — "ship with the listed fixes". Caught a real safety hole the
collapse had introduced: the generic atom-B definition would have let an owner instruction
("stamp it, I eyeballed the diff") certify GATED-THIS-DIFF, losing the `ONLY` the old text had.
Also caught that the count had fallen to four rather than one, that positional row references
decay more silently than named ones, that `9(a)` sat outside the replacement range still naming an
abolished term, and four pieces of coverage that survived only in the deleted restatements. All
applied.

**Round 1 wording items** fixed 2026-08-03: R6 (what "3 rounds" counts), R5 (`locally_verified` vs
`externally_reverified`), R12 (an owner round never satisfies cross-model), N13 (the Codex-host
recommendation no longer leads with scarce-credit Antigravity).
