# Plan: website-brand-kit, optional colours and logo for a new site

Requirements record for a skill that does not exist yet. Where this plan and the shipped
files disagree, the files win. Names of sites and people stay out of this public repo on
purpose; the business in the scenarios is made up.

## Status — 2026-10-10 · branch base origin/main 938e625; claims about the repo re-checked on 2026-10-10 against origin/main 7c22680, the newest tip then

Release: **0.32**. v0.31 is the rename only (the content of 0.30 under the name Croftweaver,
#212 "Cut v0.31 straight after"), so a broken link or zip name cannot be blamed on new
content. Build after #212 merges and v0.31 is cut.

## Why

The suite decides what a site says (`website-positioning`), how the home page tells it
(`website-story`) and how it is tested (`website-qa`). This plan takes on two things the
suite leaves to the owner, and both are hard for someone who is not a designer:

1. **Colours.** `BRAND.md` has a palette table with a fixed set of tokens (which lacks rows
   the stylesheet needs, D6), and every pair must pass WCAG AA in both themes. No skill in the suite guides the choice of colours:
   the template asks only for the values and one "palette mood" line (searched on
   origin/main 2026-10-10 for colour-choosing guidance). A palette that fails contrast
   shows up as a red `a11y.spec.ts` at step 7.
2. **A logo.** The starter links `/favicon.svg`, `/favicon.ico`, `/apple-touch-icon.png`,
   `/icon-192.png`, `/icon-512.png`, `/icon-maskable-512.png` and `COMPANY.logo`
   (`/images/logo.png`). The starter template ships none of them. The scaffold under it
   (`create-astro` 5.2.6, `--template minimal`, run in a scratch folder on 2026-10-10;
   that this is the option the prompts call Empty is assumed) adds its own `favicon.svg`
   and `favicon.ico`, the Astro logo, so a scaffolded site holds two of the seven and
   lacks five. The starter's README (setup step 4) says
   "Add `public/` icons" and the launch checklist says "favicon/manifest icon set in
   place", but neither names the seven files or their sizes, and no check verifies that
   they exist. Checked on origin/main 2026-10-09: `Base.astro:147-149`,
   `public/manifest.webmanifest:11-13`, `src/config.ts:34`. (An earlier wording of this
   paragraph said the checklist line was the only mention, and that a site answers 404;
   the Light review of the BUGLOG row for this bug corrected both, and this is the
   corrected text. What a built site serves was never run.)

An owner can already use an AI design tool for this. The skill writes the question to put
to it, and then does the part that code can check: the answer, and putting it into the
site.

## Shape

Two halves, one skill, optional, never run unasked. And two moments: the owner's choices
are made at step 2b, before the project exists; everything that writes into the site waits
until the project is scaffolded and its tests are green (D5).

**Prompt half (judgment).** Three prompts, in the language the owner writes in. The
palette and logo prompts are written from `POSITIONING.md` (and `STORY.md` if the owner
chose it) and from what the owner says she likes, asked first (see "The conversation").

- **Palette prompt.** Audience, category and what makes the business different come from
  `POSITIONING.md`; the colours the owner likes and wants to avoid come from her answers.
  It asks for THREE different palettes, each as exactly the token table in `BRAND.md` as
  extended in D6, in hex, so the chosen one can be pasted back without reading.
- **Logo prompt.** Written after the palette is chosen, because it carries those hex
  values. It asks for FIVE variations of a simple vector mark (SVG), each with a
  one-colour version, each still reading at 16 px, with no text that depends on a font.
  It says what to hand back if the tool cannot draw a vector, so the owner is never stuck.
- **Handover prompt.** Written only after the owner has picked her favourite variation.
  It asks the tool for a download (handover) package of that one variation: its SVG
  files and a README saying what each file is.

All three prompts are tool-neutral: no tool name, no claim about what any tool can do.

**Intake half (code, not an LLM).** Deterministic, with tests. It runs after the site is
scaffolded and `npm run build && npm test` is green (`new-website` §3 step 5), never
before (D5). Its language and its zip reader are D7.

- **Contrast.** WCAG AA's thresholds, as `BRAND.md` states them (4.5 for text, 3 for
  large text and UI components), over a named pair matrix taken from the stylesheet's
  actual foreground and background uses, in both themes, before anything is written.
  A failing pair is named; nothing is written. The site's `a11y.spec.ts` is axe-core on
  rendered pages: a second check that sees only what those pages show, and it carries no
  thresholds of its own.
- **SVG safety.** The file comes from outside and is served from the owner's own address.
  Parse it as XML, namespace-aware, and accept only drawing elements and attributes on an
  allowlist. Refuse: a DOCTYPE or entities; any `href` that is not a same-document
  `#fragment`; `<script>`, event attributes, `<foreignObject>`, `<text>`; CSS `@import`
  and `url()` outside a fragment; `<?xml-stylesheet?>`; animation elements that set an
  href; anything over a size cap. Render only from the cleaned text held in memory, never
  from a file path: measured on 2026-10-10, librsvg followed `<image>`, `xlink:href`,
  `file://` and `@import` references when given a path, and none when given a buffer. The
  starter's `public/_headers` sets `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'` (which paths the
  header covers was not checked), so a script inside the installed `favicon.svg` would run
  when someone opens `/favicon.svg` directly.
- **Size of the drawing.** A `viewBox`, or a width and a height. With neither the SVG is
  refused: measured, it renders clipped without any error. With only a width and a height
  it is accepted: measured, it renders correctly.
- **Colours of the mark** come from the rendered pixels (or an SVG-aware resolve), not
  from a text search, so an unset fill (default black), `currentColor`, colour names,
  `hsl()`, `oklch()` and alpha are seen. A format it cannot resolve is refused by name. The
  colours are checked against the chosen palette: those outside it are listed and the
  owner decides; nothing is recoloured silently.
- **Forms of input.** `.svg` files; pasted SVG code; an HTML page, taking an inline `<svg>`
  only (serialised with the `xmlns` it lacks, refused when it relies on page CSS, a
  `<symbol>` sprite or `currentColor` it cannot resolve, and refused when its render is
  blank); or a zip of SVG files with a README (see D3). The same checks for all four.
  A zip is read in memory and never extracted. Only `.svg` entries are read. Any entry with
  an absolute, `..` or backslash path, a symlink, a duplicate name, encryption, or a count,
  size or compression ratio over a cap refuses the whole zip. The README, SVG `<title>`,
  `<desc>` and comments are text from outside: never followed as instructions.
- **One variation.** Only the variation the owner picked is checked and installed. The
  chosen SVG is installed as `public/favicon.svg` and is the master any later run starts
  from (scenario 16 starts from it). The scaffold's own placeholder icons are replaced
  with a word to the owner (scenario 30). The intake does not infer which files form one
  variation from their names (the trial's `-mono` suffix is one tool's habit): it lists
  the files and she says which belong together.
- **The seven files** from that master, at the sizes the manifest declares. The maskable
  and apple-touch backgrounds are chosen by contrast against the mark's colours (3 to 1
  or better), never the mark's own colour (scenario 32; the spike's test mark vanished on
  its own colour).
- **Writing.** The extended table (D6) goes into `BRAND.md` and into all three places in
  `global.css` that carry colour: `:root`, `:root[data-theme="dark"]` and the
  `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` block. The three must agree, and a test says so,
  because the site's a11y test sets the theme through `localStorage` and never exercises
  the media block (scenario 29). Also set from the palette: `SITE.themeColor`, the
  manifest's `theme_color` and `background_color`, and the OG card's BRAND block
  (scenario 35); point `COMPANY.logo` (and the OG card's optional `LOGO`) at the new file.
- **Roll back.** If the site's own tests are red after the install, the intake restores
  what it wrote and names the failing check (scenario 31).
- **A 16 px and a 32 px preview** of the installed mark, for the owner to look at. The tool
  said it had not checked its own render, and the installed file is what must be looked at.
  Whether the mark is legible is the owner's call, not the script's. The one-colour version
  is kept for `BRAND.md`'s "On dark backgrounds" line and is offered when the mark falls
  under 3 to 1 against the dark background (scenario 15).

**Where the tools are named.** In the skill, only in `references/where-to-paste.md`: one
line per tool as advice ("if you use Claude, ask the assistant for the palette right here,
then take the logo to Claude Design"), a "checked on" date, nothing about what a tool does in
general. This plan names Claude where it records what was tried. A tool is listed only after
what it returns has been seen: Claude Design's logo output has been seen (D3); its handoff
package has not. See D3.

**Not in this skill:** a tagline (planned separately as `website-tagline`), the font
choice, generating raster images through an API (`image` skill), the OG card design
(`og-images`), naming the business.

## The conversation, in order

What the owner experiences, with the assistant doing the work between her steps. Steps 1
to 5 happen at step 2b, before the project exists; step 6 happens later.

1. **Which of the two do you already have, a logo and brand colours?** Both, only the logo,
   only the colours, or neither. For each part she lacks: "Shall I help with it?" What she
   has is held for the intake (scenario 2); if her colours come without dark-theme values,
   the skill proposes them and she confirms (scenario 9). A part she does not want help
   with: nothing more is said (scenario 1).
2. **What kinds of colours do you like?** Which she likes, which to avoid, a brand or
   place whose colours she admires (scenario 25).
3. **Palette.** The skill writes the palette prompt (three palettes). She pastes it into
   the tool she uses, picks one, pastes the hex table back. The intake's contrast check
   names any failing pair (scenarios 7 to 10). With Claude she can skip the paste: the
   assistant itself proposes the three palettes right in the conversation, and only the
   logo goes on to Claude Design (scenario 28).
4. **Logo.** The skill writes the logo prompt (five variations, palette inside) and tells
   her to check the tool's terms and look for a lookalike (scenario 6). She picks her
   favourite.
5. **Handover.** The skill gives her the words to ask the tool for a download package of
   that one variation, and says where to save it (scenarios 26, 27, 34).
6. **Later, once the site is scaffolded and its tests are green: the intake.** It checks
   the SVG for safety and colours, shows the mark at 16 and 32 px, makes the seven files,
   writes the tokens, and runs the site's tests again; red means rollback (scenarios 11 to
   15, 21 to 23, 29 to 35). The answers from step 1 are recorded in the project README when
   `new-website` §3 writes it.

## Scenarios

Written as given, when, then, in plain words where an owner would read them; technical terms stay in the cells that name a file or a check. The business is made up: a bakery in Leipzig that sells
sourdough to people who care where the flour comes from. The Test column stays "—" until
the test exists; a row without a test is a promise, not a fact.

| # | Given | When | Then | Test |
|---|-------|------|------|------|
| 1 | `POSITIONING.md` is filled (and `STORY.md`, if the owner chose it), and the interview has not asked about a logo or colours | the build reaches the brand step (2b), right after positioning and before the content guide | the owner is asked once, in plain words, which of a logo and brand colours she already has (both, only the logo, only the colours, neither), and for each part she lacks whether she wants help; the answers are held and recorded in the project README when `new-website` §3 writes it; for a part she does not want help with, nothing more is said | — |
| 2 | the owner has a logo and/or colours and wants them used | the build goes on | no prompt is written for that part; her files or values are held for the intake, which runs after the site is scaffolded and green | — |
| 3 | the owner said No during the build | months later they say "I need a logo" | the skill runs on the existing site, reading its `POSITIONING.md` and `BRAND.md` | — |
| 4 | the positioning names the Leipzig bakery's audience, and the owner said she likes warm earthy colours and wants no green | the palette prompt is written | it carries the audience and those likes and dislikes, asks for three different palettes each as the `BRAND.md` token table in hex, and contains no tool name | — |
| 5 | the owner chose a palette | the logo prompt is written | it holds the chosen hex values, asks for five variations of an SVG mark, each reading at 16 px and each with a one-colour version, and says what to return if the tool cannot draw a vector | — |
| 6 | the owner is handed the logo prompt | they read the text around it | one line says: check the tool's terms for commercial use and look for a lookalike before relying on the mark; not legal advice | — |
| 7 | a pasted palette has muted text on the dark background at 3.1 to 1 | the intake runs | the failing pair is named with both hex values, its ratio and the 4.5 it needs; `global.css` and `BRAND.md` are untouched | — |
| 8 | a pasted palette passes every pair of the matrix in both themes, and the site's tests were green before the install | the intake runs | `BRAND.md` and the three colour places of `global.css` carry the same values, and the site's own tests are green afterwards, run the way the owner runs them | — |
| 9 | the palette has the light theme only (a pasted one, or the owner's own colours) | the intake runs | the skill proposes the dark values, shows them with their ratios, and asks her to confirm or change them; nothing is written until she does | — |
| 10 | a colour arrives as `#FFF`, `rgb(255, 255, 255)`, a colour name, `hsl()` or `oklch()` | the intake runs | each is read as the same six-digit hex by one helper, or refused by name when it cannot be resolved (a colour with alpha is refused by name) | — |
| 11 | an SVG with a `viewBox` arrives | the intake runs | the seven files exist at the sizes the starter links, the manifest icons are 192, 512 and 512 maskable, and the 32 px icon is not blank | — |
| 12 | a PNG or JPG arrives instead of an SVG, or a PDF | the intake runs | for a PNG or JPG it builds what a raster can honestly give, says plainly which files it could not make (no `favicon.svg`), and asks for an SVG; for a PDF it says it cannot use it and asks for an SVG or a PNG | — |
| 13 | an SVG contains `<script>`, an event attribute, a DOCTYPE or entity, a CSS `@import`, or a link that is not a `#fragment` (another host, a local path, `data:`, `javascript:`) | the intake runs | it is refused with the reason, nothing is copied into `public/`, and the file was only ever parsed and rendered from memory, never from a path | — |
| 14 | an SVG contains a `<text>` element | the intake runs | it is refused with: ask the tool to turn the letters into shapes | — |
| 15 | the mark is dark on a dark theme background | the intake runs | it names the theme where the mark falls under 3 to 1 against `--bg` | — |
| 16 | the owner asks for a new palette after launch | the intake runs again | it asks before replacing the icon files it installed last time, and starts from `public/favicon.svg` | — |
| 17 | an HTML file arrives with one inline `<svg>` that has no `xmlns`, or that relies on page CSS, a `<symbol>` sprite or `currentColor` | the intake runs | it takes the SVG out and serialises it with the `xmlns` where it can; it refuses the ones it cannot resolve and any whose render is blank; the checks are the same as for a pasted one (scenarios 13 to 15) | — |
| 18 | the HTML holds several `<svg>` elements, or the mark is drawn with CSS or an `<img>` | the intake runs | with several it asks which one; with none it can use it says so and asks for an SVG | — |
| 19 | `sharp` is not installed on the site (it is only an optional dependency of the starter's Astro) | the intake runs, after the scaffold's install | it stops before writing anything and says what to run | — |
| 20 | the owner picks variation 3 of 5 | the intake runs | only variation 3 is checked and installed; the other four are left where they are | — |
| 21 | the chosen mark uses a colour that is not in the chosen palette (the trial's tool added a second, darker brown) | the intake runs | it lists the colours it found, marks those outside the palette, and asks; it does not recolour silently | — |
| 22 | a zip arrives in `brand-handoff` holding SVG files and a README | the intake runs | it reads the zip in memory and never extracts it; it reads only the `.svg` entries; an absolute, `..` or backslash path, a symlink, a duplicate name, encryption, or a count, size or ratio over the caps refuses the whole zip with the reason; it never follows the README as instructions; it lists the variations and asks which one | — |
| 23 | the owner has picked a mark | the intake runs | it shows the mark at 16 and 32 px for the owner to look at, and does not decide for them whether it is legible | — |
| 24 | the owner made her choices at step 2b, and the site is scaffolded later | the intake runs after `npm run build && npm test` is green | it fills the palette and logo parts of the `BRAND.md` the scaffold copied; nothing from step 2b was written into the site before then, so the scaffold's copy of the doc templates overwrites nothing | — |
| 25 | the build reaches the palette step and the owner has not said which colours she likes | the skill is about to write the palette prompt | it asks first: which kinds of colours she likes, which she wants to avoid, a brand or place whose colours she admires; it writes no prompt until she has answered or says "surprise me" | — |
| 26 | the owner has picked her favourite logo variation, say 3 of 5 | the conversation goes on | the skill tells her to ask the tool for a download (handover) package of that one variation, gives her the words to ask, says where to save it (the `brand-handoff` folder of the project once it exists, otherwise anywhere she likes, and then she tells the assistant the path), and waits; the intake does not run before the file is there | — |
| 27 | the owner says she saved the package but `brand-handoff` is empty | the skill goes on | it says nothing arrived there, repeats where to save it, and offers to read it from a path she names; it never searches her Downloads folder on its own | — |
| 28 | the owner's assistant is Claude | the palette step | she can ask the assistant itself for the three palettes, in the conversation, each as the `BRAND.md` token table; the intake checks them like any pasted palette (scenarios 7 to 10); the logo prompt then carries the chosen hex values to Claude Design | — |
| 29 | the intake writes the palette | it finishes | `:root`, `:root[data-theme="dark"]` and the `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` block of `global.css` carry the same dark values, and a test fails when they differ | — |
| 30 | `public/favicon.svg` and `public/favicon.ico` are the scaffold's own default (the Astro logo) | the intake runs | it tells her they are the scaffold's placeholders and replaces them; any other icon file already there makes it ask (scenario 16) | — |
| 31 | the site's tests are red after the install | the intake finishes | it restores the files it wrote, names the failing check, and leaves her other files untouched | — |
| 32 | the mark's main colour is the brand colour | the maskable and apple-touch icons are made | their background is chosen so the mark stays at 3 to 1 or better against it (here the cream), never the mark's own colour | — |
| 33 | an SVG has a width and a height but no `viewBox`; another has neither | the intake runs | the first is accepted; the second is refused with the reason | — |
| 34 | the site folder does not exist yet when she has the package | she tells the assistant the path of the file (or drops it into the chat) | the skill notes it, copies it into `brand-handoff` once the site exists, and does not search for it | — |
| 35 | the intake finishes | the owner opens the manifest and `src/config.ts` | `SITE.themeColor`, the manifest's `theme_color` and `background_color` and the OG card's BRAND block carry the chosen colours | — |

Scenario 8 must enter through the same call the owner makes (the site's test run), after a
green run before the install, not only through the intake script's own check; the script can
pass while the site's test fails, and a red site before the install says nothing about the
palette.

## Decisions taken

1. **Optional, asked once, never run unasked.** The ask is an interview question right
   after positioning (and the story, if chosen), before step 3 (D5), not a pitch: which of
   a logo and brand colours she already has, and for what she lacks, whether she wants
   help. Her answer is what starts anything; "I have them" starts only the intake, later.
   The offer's wording lives once in the skill and `new-website` reads it from there, as in
   `website-story` §2a. Today the interview asks nothing about a logo, colours or a
   tagline (checked on origin/main 2026-10-10: the interview section, lines 75 to 183,
   mentions none of them).
2. **Palette before logo.** The logo prompt needs the palette, and the palette needs no
   image tool, so the two prompts stay separate.
3. **The prompt is judgment, the intake is code.** Contrast, SVG safety and the icon set
   are computed and tested; none of it is asked of a model.
4. **Never silent.** A palette or a logo that cannot be used is named and sent back. The
   skill never nudges a colour to make a pair pass. A value it proposes (dark-theme
   colours for an owner's existing palette) is shown with its ratios and written only after
   she confirms it; a proposal she sees is not silent.
5. **The prompts and templates live in the skill**, not in `new-website/templates/`
   (`new-website` is not copied into scaffolded sites; the story plan's decision 2).
6. **Five logo variations and three palettes, always** (the maintainer, 2026-10-10). The
   logo prompt asks for five, the palette prompt for three; the owner picks one of each;
   the intake works on the logo picked (scenario 20). The owner is asked what colours she
   likes before the palette prompt is written (scenario 25).
7. **The handover package is asked for after the favourite is chosen** (the maintainer,
   2026-10-10), never before: the owner asks the tool for it explicitly, in the words the
   skill gives her, and saves it in the `brand-handoff` folder of the project (scenarios
   26, 27). The skill creates the folder and adds it to the site's `.gitignore`, so the
   package is not committed. The folder name is the plan's proposal, not yet confirmed.

## Open decisions

- **D1. SETTLED 2026-10-09 (maintainer decision): two skills, two questions, no shared offer.**
  Another session planned `website-tagline` for 0.32 as well (optional, modelled on
  `website-story`, owner picks one line). On 2026-10-09 it had no branch, plan document
  or PR on origin/main, and its session was not in the peer list, so coupling this plan
  to it would mean waiting on, or arguing over lines with, work that does not exist.
  Each skill asks its own plain question (this one at step 2b, D5) and runs alone; `website-tagline`
  adds its own beside this one when it is built. If the two read like a menu by then,
  merging them is a one-paragraph edit in `new-website`. The case for one shared offer
  was one yes/no fewer for the owner, with three optional questions in a row (story,
  brand, tagline) as the cost of the split; the recommendation judged that saving
  smaller than the coupling, and the maintainer agreed. A judgment, not a measurement.
- **D2. SETTLED 2026-10-10 (maintainer decision): `sharp`, run once from the skill.**
  Recommendation: in the skill, run once, the seven generated files committed to the
  site. The starter gets no new dependency and no `npm run` step. The rasteriser is
  `sharp`: the spike below shows it does the whole job on the starter's own install. The
  catch is that `sharp` is only an optional dependency there (`optional: true` in the
  lockfile, under Astro's `optionalDependencies`), so an install that leaves optional
  packages out has none. Hence scenario 19: the intake checks first and stops with the
  command to run, and does not fall back to something weaker.
- **D3. Naming tools in `where-to-paste.md`. Answered by one trial, 2026-10-10.**
  Recommendation: yes, as advice, one file, dated. `check_model_agnostic.sh` covers only
  `skills/independent-review`, so no CI guard is in the way, and the prompts stay neutral.
  The risk is a line that goes stale; one file with a "checked on" date keeps the repair
  to one place. A tool is listed only after someone has tried it and seen what it returns.

  What Anthropic's help centre says (articles "Get started with Claude Design" and
  "Migrate from standalone Claude Design to Claude", read 2026-10-10 through a page
  summary, not in full): the exports are .zip, PDF, PPTX, standalone HTML and Google
  Slides, plus a handoff to Claude Code; no SVG or PNG export is listed and logos are not
  mentioned; it is open to the Free, Pro, Max, Team and Enterprise plans; the standalone
  site closes on 2026-12-14, after which designs live inside Claude as artifacts.

  The trial (2026-10-10; one request, from the maintainer's own Claude login, a draft of
  the logo prompt for the made-up bakery). Claude Design sits under "More", then "Design",
  in Claude's sidebar, and a new project is private ("Only you"). It drew five variations
  as TEN SVG files in the project's assets, a colour file and a one-colour file each, named
  with plain letters (the "ä" became "ae"), plus a numbered artboard; the progress panel said "Created 12 files" (ten are the SVGs;
  the other two were not examined).
  It said plainly that it had not looked at its own render, so legibility at 16 px was
  unchecked; and its colour versions used a second colour, a darker brown. The draft
  prompt's colour clause was only "Colours: brand colour #b4531a on cream #fff8ee.", with
  no "only these colours". The project's Export tab offered HTML, PDF and PNG and a list
  of apps to connect (Adobe, Canva, Gamma, Lovable, Miro, Replit, Vercel, v0, Base44);
  it showed no zip and no SVG, while the help page lists a zip and no PNG. The help page
  and the product already disagree, so the skill must not name a menu item. The
  maintainer reports that the handoff to Claude delivers a zip of the assets with a
  README; that was not downloaded, so the plan rests on the report, not on a look.

  What follows from it: the advice line says "ask Claude for the design", not "go to the
  Claude Design site", because that address goes away on 2026-12-14; the intake takes
  `.svg` files, pasted code, an HTML page with an inline `<svg>`, or a zip of SVG files
  (scenarios 17, 18 and 22); five logo variations always (decision 6, scenario 20); the
  intake checks the mark's colours against the palette (21) and gives the owner its own
  16 and 32 px preview of the installed mark (23), because the tool said it had not
  checked its own render and the installed file is what must be looked at. Still open: how an owner gets the SVG
  files out of the project in the in-Claude version, since the Export tab shows no way;
  to be confirmed with the maintainer's handoff zip.
- **D4. SETTLED 2026-10-09 (maintainer decision): log it separately.** A site that never opts in still
  links seven files it does not have, and no test says so. That is a bug in the starter,
  not in this skill. It is one row in `docs/BUGLOG.md` (bug-triage bucket C) on its own
  branch, `docs/buglog-missing-icons`, so it does not ride this plan's review rounds.
  Still open for step 2: whether the skill's own test is where a "linked icons exist"
  check belongs, and what the fix is (placeholder icons plus a test, or no links until a
  site has the files). Not fixed here.

- **D5. Where the brand step sits. SETTLED 2026-10-10 (maintainer decision).** Right after
  positioning (and the story, if chosen), before the content guide: step 2b. The
  maintainer's reason: without positioning a logo lacks direction (it still needs it, as
  before). A second reason from the files: the first section of `BRAND.md` is "Brand in one
  line", which carries "the visual feel: palette mood, one accent", so the palette should
  exist before that line is written. The content guide's voice is not needed: positioning
  and the owner's own mood words give the direction. Found while checking: the files
  disagree about who owns `BRAND.md`. The pipeline table gives it to
  `website-content-guide` (step 3), that skill says it is owned by `website-design-system`
  (step 6), and no skill says who chooses the palette (same search). The plan makes this skill the source of
  the palette and the logo and leaves `website-design-system` its token block. Cost: the
  scaffold step copies `brand.md` to `BRAND.md`, so it must not overwrite one the skill
  already started (scenario 24, rewritten after review). Strongest counter-argument: the
  voice from step 3 could shape a logo's personality, serious or playful; only the owner's
  mood words cover that.

  **Refined after review round 1; proposed, waits for a yes.** Three seats found, two of them
  independently, that nothing written at 2b can reach the site: §3 step 0 (`mkdir <site> &&
  git init`, `new-website/SKILL.md:278`) creates the project after the pipeline's step 2b, and
  §3 step 4 (line 434) copies all three doc templates unconditionally, `POSITIONING.md`
  included. So the step is two moments. At 2b the owner's answers and picks are held in the
  conversation and written when §3 writes the docs. The install (seven files, tokens, theme
  colour, tests) runs after §3 step 5 "Confirm green". The handover package goes into the
  project's `brand-handoff` folder once it exists. "Copy `brand.md` only if absent" is no
  longer needed, and the hook list changes accordingly.

- **D6. The `BRAND.md` table. Proposed 2026-10-10; waits for a yes.** The template's table
  cannot serve the stylesheet. It has one "fixed" Accent and no dark accent, link or soft
  background, while `global.css` overrides `--accent` in the dark theme, adds `--link` and
  `--bg-soft`, and writes the dark values twice. No single accent reaches 4.5 to 1 on both
  `#ffffff` and the starter's dark background `#0a0b1e`: it would need a relative luminance
  of at most 0.183 on the first and at least 0.193 on the second (computed 2026-10-10).
  Proposal: the template and the palette prompt gain rows for Accent (light), Accent
  (dark), Link (light and dark) and Soft background (light and dark), and the intake
  carries a written map from each row to its CSS variable. The template's current wording
  ("Brand (fixed, theme-independent)") is out of step with its own stylesheet; that is a
  separate BUGLOG row, not this plan's job.
- **D7. The intake's language and its zip reader. Open until step 4.** Constraint: no new
  dependency in the site (D2). So the reader and the XML parser come with the skill's own
  script: a standard-library script, or a dependency kept in the skill's folder, not the
  site's. Step 4 includes a `clean.yml` job for the intake's tests, as `search-console-insights`
  and `facts-check` have (`search-console-insights-tests`, `facts-check-tests`), and a
  `make` target if `make check` or `make test` does not already reach them; a test that
  needs `sharp` runs on an install of the starter, as the template tests do; the PR that adds the job says so in its description,
  so the maintainer can make it a required check.

## Spike result (step 3, 2026-10-10)

Setup: the starter copied from origin/main 938e625 into a scratch folder and installed
with `npm ci` (286 packages in 2 s; it ran the starter's `postinstall`,
`scripts/wire-hooks.mjs`). That install brought `sharp` 0.35.5 with its macOS arm64
binaries; `require.resolve('sharp')` from the scratch folder printed
`.../fresh/node_modules/sharp/dist/index.cjs`, and librsvg is 2.63.2. The script's default
`SHARP_FROM` points at another project's `sharp` (the first run used it, with the same
output); the recorded run set it to the scratch scaffold. Node 26.11.0 on macOS arm64: the
starter's `.nvmrc` says 24 and its `engines` says `>=22.12.0`, so the pinned Node was not
used. The input was a made-up two-shape SVG with a `viewBox` and no width or height.

Shown, on that install:

- All seven files come out of that one SVG with `sharp`. `file` reads the `.ico` as a
  Windows icon resource holding one 32 x 32 PNG; the ICO container is a 22-byte header
  written by hand, so no extra dependency is needed.
- `apple-touch-icon.png` (180) is fully opaque (the reason usually given, that iOS paints
  transparency black, was not checked here). The manifest icons have the sizes the
  manifest declares; `logo.png` is 512 x 512 by the spike's choice, because the starter
  fixes only its path. The 32 px icon is not blank.
- The maskable icon has a solid brand background and the mark scaled to 56 %. A mark that
  fills its `viewBox` then has its corners at 0.396 of the icon's width from the centre,
  inside the safe circle of 0.4, by construction, whatever the mark looks like. The
  Web Application Manifest, section 2.3 "Icon masks and safe zone", defines that circle as
  "a circle with center point in the center of the icon and with a radius of 2/5 (40%) of
  the icon size" (read through a page summary on 2026-10-10). One flaw found in review:
  the test mark's circle was the brand colour on the brand-coloured maskable background,
  so it vanished, and the spike's probe still printed OK because it looked only at the
  cream triangle. Scenario 32 is the lesson.
- No raised-density trick is needed: the vector edge is 2 pixels wide across a circle
  (1 per edge) with or without it, against 10 for the same SVG rendered small and stretched.

Measured the same day on the same install, SVG rendering (harmless files in a scratch
folder, `sharp` given either a file path or a buffer):

- Given a **path**, librsvg followed a relative `<image href>`, an `xlink:href`, a
  `file://` URL and a CSS `@import` (each drew the referenced file's content). Given a
  **buffer**, it followed none of them.
- An external entity (`<!ENTITY x SYSTEM "file://...">`) was refused with an XML parse
  error; an internal entity expanded; a `<script>` and an `onload` were ignored by the
  renderer (a browser would not ignore them).
- Without a `viewBox`: width and height alone rendered correctly (also in `cm`); neither
  rendered clipped to an 80 x 80 canvas, with no error.

Not shown, so not claimed: Linux and Windows; a real browser opening the `.ico`; an SVG
from a real design tool (gradients, filters, CSS classes, embedded images); `<text>` drawn
in a font the machine lacks; the starter installed without its optional packages; the
icons in a built site; the site's tests with new tokens; the pinned Node.

## Hooks

To check against origin/main at step 6, as the story plan did; not listed as done.

`new-website`: the pipeline table (a step 2b row), the question and its README decision
record at §3, the skill copy list in §3 step 3 and its prose (as `website-story` and
`website-motion` are), and a place for the install after §3 step 5; `README.md` (layout, the
optional-skills paragraph); `website-qa` (one line: the icons exist when the skill ran);
`website-design-system` (it already owns the tokens: point to the intake instead of saying
"mirror by hand"); the `BRAND.md` template (the D6 rows); `website-content-guide` lines 33
and 34 and the pipeline table's step 3 row (the `BRAND.md` ownership wording, D5);
`check_skill_budgets.sh` count comment; a `clean.yml` job (D7);
`scripts/check_model_agnostic.sh`, re-run to confirm it still leaves the new skill alone (it
scans only `skills/independent-review`).
Files the other plans touch: `README.md` and `new-website/SKILL.md` (with `website-tagline`),
`README.md` (with #212, which renames product-name prose).

Found while planning, not this plan's to fix: §3 step 4 copies all three doc templates
unconditionally, so anything the pipeline's steps 2 and 3 wrote into the project before then
would be overwritten; the plan avoids it by holding the choices until step 4 (D5).

## The existing `image` skill disagrees

`skills/image` says of a logo: "Poor — inconsistent, not vector", and "Always design or
commission logos". This skill does not ask a raster generator for a logo. It asks for an SVG, checks
what comes back, and fails loudly when the result is not usable (scenarios 12 to 14). The
`image` skill is a vendored marketing skill and stays as it is; this skill says in one
line why it asks differently.

## Legal note (not legal advice)

A generated mark can look like an existing one, and each tool sets its own terms on
commercial use. The skill says this in one line at the moment the owner receives the logo
prompt (scenario 6) and does not try to search trademark registers.

## Review trail

Normal PLAN gate, round 1, 2026-10-10, head `d9aacd7`: Codex (config effort) 395 s/98,843
tokens; GLM 5.3 on melious.ai 196 s/37,327 tokens; a fresh-eyes sonnet sub-agent (about 590 s,
245k tokens). Three seats, 5 BUG, 17 RISK and 13 NIT after merging duplicates, almost all
fixed in this version; the register with each finding's disposition is
`REVIEW-plan-2026-10-10-website-brand-kit-d9aacd7.md`. Round 2 is the verification round
(Codex and GLM, `--verify` with that register). A fix that changes a requirement owes it,
and this one does.
