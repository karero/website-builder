# test_install_pin.sh — drives scripts/install.sh and its Codex mirror against a
# throwaway repo, one of whose skills is symlinked into a SIBLING WORKTREE of the same
# repo (a pin: that skill runs at a vetted commit, not at whatever the checkout holds).
#
# Why it exists: both installers removed any existing symlink and re-pointed it at the
# checkout, so re-running one silently undid such a pin — the pinned skill quietly went
# back to following the checkout, with nothing said. A pin is now kept, and these cases
# pin all three parts of that: what counts as a pin (a linked worktree of this repo, at
# the same skill), what does not (the main checkout, another skill, another repo), and
# that every case where the guard cannot run says so instead of clobbering in silence.
