# Guard: per-skill size budgets. Two budgets per skills/*/SKILL.md:
#   - frontmatter `description` ≤ 1024 CHARACTERS — the skill-spec HARD limit
#     (tooling that indexes skills truncates or rejects longer ones). FAIL when
#     over; warn from 900 so a skill nearing the ceiling is visible before it
#     turns the gate red. Pre-existing overages are allowlisted below,
#     shrink-only, so the gate can land without blocking unrelated work while
#     still refusing NEW violations and any growth of the old ones.
#   - SKILL.md ≤ 500 lines — the skill-authoring guideline. SOFT budget: warn
#     only, never fail — an over-long body degrades quality, not loading, and
#     two shipped skills already sit over it while being slimmed down.
# Added 2026-08-29 after the skill-debloat review (finding D15): one description
# had silently grown ~60% past the hard limit with nothing in place to catch it.

# Descriptions over DESC_HARD that are tolerated for now, pinned so they can
# only shrink. This started as four entries, all predating the check; the
# skill-debloat work (#85) then trimmed three of them back under the limit and
# those entries came out in this same change — the stale-entry FAIL is what
# forced the cleanup, exactly as intended.
#
# The one left is NOT leftover debt: the careful-interpretation hardening (#86)
# GREW this description from 1603 to 1716 while the check was in review. It is
# now the only skill over the spec limit, and by a wide margin. Trimming it is
# a content decision for that skill's owner, so it is re-pinned at its current
# length rather than edited here.
#
# Caps are the YAML-parsed value lengths (see desc_of) and each pin must EQUAL
# the current value: a trim lowers the pin in the same change, so regrowth
# under a stale cap has nowhere to hide. For clip-chomped (`>`) blocks the
# parsed value includes a trailing newline, so a pin reads one higher than the
# visible text — that is correct, do not "fix" it. One entry per skill;
# duplicates FAIL.

# Print the YAML-parsed frontmatter description of a SKILL.md, exactly as a
# real YAML parser would return it, for the shapes this suite uses:
#   - single-line plain/quoted scalars, verbatim (outer quotes stripped);
#   - block scalars `>` `>-` `|` `|-` with a uniform indent: folded joins
#     lines with spaces and turns each blank line into a newline, literal
#     joins every line with a newline (plus one per blank line), and clip
#     chomping (`>`/`|`) contributes its trailing newline.
# Every other shape is REFUSED — output is empty and the caller fails loud
# instead of measuring a truncated or under-counted string: multi-line
# plain/quoted scalars (an indented continuation after the value line, blank
# lines included), keep chomping (`>+`/`|+`), block headers beyond the four
# bare forms (indentation indicators like `>2`, trailing comments), blank
# lines before a block's first content line, any block line whose indent
# differs from the first content line's, tabs in or immediately after a
# block's indentation (YAML indent is spaces-only; a tab there is content a
# real parser keeps), whitespace-only block lines wider than the indent (a
# real parser keeps the excess as content), alias values (`*ref` expands to
# the anchored content — unmeasurable here), duplicate description keys (a
# real parser returns the LAST value, not the first), and plain values a
# real parser rejects or resolves to non-strings (anchors, tags, flow
# collections, sequence/mapping indicators, colon-space, unterminated
# quotes, value-position comments, and whole-token non-strings: null/boolean
# forms, numbers, hex/octal/binary, inf/nan, bare dates). Residual over-counts
# (quoted-scalar escapes, trailing `#` comments after a plain value, kept
# trailing spaces on block lines) err conservative: they can false-FAIL near
# the boundary, never false-pass. Frank residual gap, loud-or-conservative
# for valid YAML: a frontmatter never closed by `---` scans on into the body.
