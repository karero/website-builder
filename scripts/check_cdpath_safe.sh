# Guard: an exported CDPATH must not change what any script does.
#
# `cd "$(dirname "$0")"` is wrong when CDPATH is exported: cd searches CDPATH before the
# current directory for a relative operand, so it can land elsewhere — and it prints where it
# went, corrupting any $(...) capturing it. Both modes were live here until 2026-09-26:
# `CDPATH=/tmp/cdp make check` exited 2, and whats-new.sh resolved a relative <project_dir>
# to a same-named decoy that --refresh would then have written into.
#
# Why a guard: nothing else in this repo sets CDPATH, so a green `make check` looks identical
# whether the scripts are safe or not — the same reason check_template_coverage.sh exists.
#
# Why BEHAVIOURAL, not a grep. The first version of this guard scanned for the textual idiom.
# A review round drove a truck through it: pushd, `SELF=$(dirname "$0"); cd "$SELF"`,
# `cd "${0%/*}"`, backticks, a space after `$(`, a backslash continuation and a second cd on
# the same line all evaded it; `CDPATH=""` and `unset CDPATH` produced false FAILs; it never
# covered the caller-supplied `cd "$PROJECT"` that was the original bug; and a *.sh glob could
# not see extensionless scripts. Running each subject twice and comparing has none of those
# holes, because it tests behaviour instead of spelling.
#
# The comparison is between the two RUNS, deliberately not against a known-good result: a
# subject that fails for its own unrelated reason fails identically both times and is not this
# guard's business. That keeps a leaked model name (say) from also turning this job red.
