# test_mktemp_guard.sh — runs each script it lists, every one of which builds itself a
# throwaway folder and removes it on exit, with mktemp failing, from a folder holding a
# sentinel file. Each must stop at once with an error and leave that folder as it found it.
#
# Why it exists: these scripts made their folder with
#     T="$(mktemp -d …)"; trap 'rm -rf "$T"' EXIT; T="$(CDPATH= cd -- "$T" && pwd -P)"
# and never looked at mktemp's status. When mktemp failed (TMPDIR naming a folder that is
# missing or read-only, a full disk), T was empty and bash's `cd ""` stayed where it was. T
# became the folder the script was started in, the whole suite ran there and printed "all
# checks passed", and the EXIT trap deleted the folder. Under `make check` that folder is the
# repo. The scripts that did not reassign T ran on with it empty, so every "$T/…" path pointed
# at the filesystem root. These cases pin the repair: a failed mktemp ends the script, with a
# non-zero status, on a message that says why, before it does anything else.
#
# Which scripts: any shell script that mentions mktemp is in SCRIPTS (tested here) or in
# EXEMPT (with the reason it needs no case here). The completeness check below fails until a
# new one is in one or the other, the way check_cdpath_safe.sh does for CDPATH.
#
# mktemp fails through a stub first on PATH, not through a bad TMPDIR alone: macOS's mktemp
# with no template falls back to the user's temp folder when TMPDIR is bad, so the scripts
# that call it bare would only fail on Linux. TMPDIR names a missing folder as well, as in the
# incident. HOME moves too, so a script whose guard has broken cannot touch the real one.
#
# A listed script that skips (no git, node or python3 on the machine) is reported, and not
# counted as tested. REQUIRE_EVERY_SCRIPT=1 (CI) makes a skip a failure.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test_mktemp_guard.sh
set -u

# Scripts that build a throwaway folder and remove it on exit. The first two deleted the folder
# they ran from; the rest ran on with the folder's name empty.
