# use their own CLI-configured defaults, and the docs speak in families and generic tags.
# A hardcoded default is exactly how the ollama tier once drifted out of sync with the
# owner's real setup (this script's pre-2026-08-29 ancestor, check_model_defaults.sh,
# managed that drift; this version prevents the class).

# docs/reviews/OPEN-FINDINGS-independent-review.md. Files are discovered, not
# listed, and not filtered by extension, so a new reference, script, or helper of
# any type is scanned by default instead of silently skipped (grep -I skips any
