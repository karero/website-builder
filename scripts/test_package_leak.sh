# test_package_leak.sh — drives scripts/package.sh's zip integrity check against fake zip
# listings: a copy of package.sh runs in a throwaway dir with stub `zip` and `unzip` first on
# PATH, so nothing is built and the real dist/ is never touched.
#
# Why it exists: the leak checks used to read `grep … | head -5 | grep .` under pipefail. Once
# the leaked listing passed the pipe buffer (~64 KiB), head's early exit killed the first
# grep — SIGPIPE (141), or EPIPE (exit 2) where SIGPIPE is ignored, as on GitHub Actions
# runners — pipefail reported that, the `if` went false, and the guard missed exactly the
# large leak it exists for (20,000 node_modules paths shipped; 50 were caught). Each large
# case therefore runs twice: with SIGPIPE at its default, and ignored.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test_package_leak.sh
