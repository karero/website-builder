# test_clean_denylist.sh — drives scripts/check_clean.sh's private-name check against a
# throwaway repo with a linked worktree.
#
# Why it exists: the name list is a gitignored file in the main checkout, so a linked
# worktree has no copy of it, and the check skipped itself there and still printed OK.
# Commits are made in worktrees, so the check was off exactly where it mattered: a client
# name reached main that way (2026-09-27). These cases pin that a worktree uses the main
# checkout's list, that a copy with no git still skips (and says so, on its OK line too),
# that CI's masked mode (CLEAN_MASK_NAMES=1) fails on a name without printing it,
# that scripts/ is scanned for names without the list matching itself, and that this repo's
# own short name in an issue or PR reference is not a leak. The names are made up; the
# real list never appears in this repo.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test_clean_denylist.sh
