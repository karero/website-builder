# Guard: the skill suite is a handoff artifact — no personal names, contact info, or
# credentials may enter it. Scans skills/ + root docs (and scripts/, for names only) and
# exits 1 (with file:line) on any hit. Wired into `make check` and CI (.github/workflows/clean.yml).
#
# Two kinds of check:
#   • DENYLIST — specific known-private identifiers, read from an OPTIONAL gitignored
#     file (scripts/.clean-denylist) so the public suite never enumerates private names.
#     Catches our own info regressing back in; skipped if the file is absent. CI writes
#     the file from the CLEAN_DENYLIST repo secret (`make push-denylist` sets it) and runs
#     with CLEAN_MASK_NAMES=1, which prints no scanned text at all, only counts, since a
#     public repo's CI logs are public (section 0 below).
#   • GENERIC  — any real email, plus credential/secret formats and secret-looking
#     assignments. Catches things no denylist could enumerate.
# A real false positive should be fixed by narrowing the pattern here, never by
# loosening it to "match nothing".

# or _ (a byte of a non-ASCII letter counts, so a listed "Caf" also matches inside "Café"), OR
# the old \b match, which alone finds an entry that starts or ends with punctuation next to a
# letter (a trailing hyphen, say). Two separate alternatives: on BSD grep, (^|\b)-name and
# name-($|\b) miss an entry whose punctuation edge touches a letter. More reports than either
# alone, never fewer: a name with a non-ASCII letter at an edge is also found inside a longer
