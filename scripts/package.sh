# Explicit file list (not the scripts/ dir) so the gitignored scripts/.clean-denylist
# can never leak into the handoff. LICENSE + THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md ship the notices the
# README points to; Makefile makes `make install` work for a zip recipient.
# docs/reviews/ holds internal review trails + plan artifacts — never handoff material.
# docs/local/ is excluded from git entirely (.git/info/exclude) for private, never-shipped
# notes — but zip -r is git-agnostic and would sweep it in anyway if it exists on disk.
# node_modules/, .astro/, __pycache__/, and test-results/ are the same class of leak: all
# gitignored (skills/new-website/templates/.gitignore + root .gitignore), so git itself never
# tracks them, but zip -r doesn't consult .gitignore either — if a template's build/test/install
# byproducts happen to exist on the machine building the release (e.g. from a prior `npm
# test`/`npm install`/`npm run build`/pytest run against the real template tree instead of a
# scratch clone), the whole tree ships in the handoff. Caught live 2026-08-09: a stray
# node_modules from an unrelated earlier session balanced a 201-file zip into 9324 files (185MB)
# before that exclusion existed; caught live 2026-08-29 (v0.23 release prep) for the other three.

# Integrity check: a handoff zip missing any of these is broken (legal notices, install
# path, the orchestrator, the architecture doc it points at, and every root file the
# orchestrator's §3 step 2 copies into a site — a zip missing one scaffolds a broken repo — plus
# the on-demand team skill and its guide, which §3 also copies). Fail loud if so.

# buffer (~64 KiB), head's early exit killed grep, pipefail reported that, and the guard missed
# exactly the large leak it exists for. A non-zero status now can only be an error (the
