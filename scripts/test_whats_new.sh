# test_whats_new.sh — runs scripts/whats-new.sh <site> against a throwaway suite repo and a
# throwaway site, and checks which frozen template files it reports as MISSING.
#
# Why it exists: the report listed every frozen file that changed upstream the same way,
# whether the site had a copy or not. A site made before scripts/verify.mjs existed read
# "verify.mjs changed upstream" as one more file to merge some day, and so ran with no local
# `astro check` gate until a broken page reached main. A file the site lacks is now marked
# MISSING and listed again at the end. These cases pin what counts: a file the site has is
# not missing, and neither is one deleted upstream. The last case checks every file in the
# real TEMPLATE_TRACKED list: the path the report shows as its site copy must be the path the
# MISSING check looks for, so the two mappings cannot drift apart or lose a file.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test_whats_new.sh
