# test_pre_push_hook.sh — drives the site template's git pre-push hook
# (skills/new-website/templates/astro/scripts/hooks/pre-push) with a stubbed `npm`, both as
# shipped and with its optional PR-only-main block uncommented.
#
# Why it exists: the hook reads git's ref lines from stdin once and replays them, so the
# block can refuse a push to main and a push that only deletes refs can skip the gate. Every
# check of that was by hand, and one round of hand checks let through a stdin guard that read
# nothing without /proc, so an enabled block waved a push to main through (PR #125). These
# cases pin what the gate does per push shape, per stdin kind and per shell, and that the
# block refuses main whatever stdin git's pipe looks like.
#
# It also runs the "prepare" script that wires the hook (the template's package.json and
# scripts/wire-hooks.mjs) through npm, to pin that the line needs no particular shell and
# that it touches git's hook folder only where the site is the root of its repo. Those cases
# need node and npm, and say so where they are skipped.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test_pre_push_hook.sh
