# re-running just refreshes the links. An existing REAL directory with the same name is
# backed up to <name>.pre-website-builder.bak rather than clobbered.
# A symlink already pointing into ANOTHER WORKTREE of this repo is left alone: that is
# a deliberate pin to a vetted commit, and relinking it would silently undo someone's
# decision about which version of a skill runs. Pass --force to relink those too.
# Pin protection is best effort: where git cannot verify a target — an old git, no git,
# or a copy that is not a repo — links are refreshed, and a note says so.
